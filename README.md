# Solitary gourmet

It's CTF write-up repository that includes some of my opinions. Every assessment of CTFs and challenges are just my opinion. You could think it's more difficult or more worthy than my assessment.

For now, every write-ups are written with Korean.

## Solving priority

Though the ultimate goal of this project is solving all pwn challenges from CTF, there is a definite time limit, since it's on my own. Hence, I consider a priority rule to achieve efficiency in this project.

Here is priority rule:

1. now running
2. high weight CTF(based on CTFtime)
3. interesting topic
4. low solves count

If I have enough time, I would solve rev/web challenges together.

## Standards

Following these standards, I would evaluate several CTF challenges.

- Challenge - Difficulty
  - :star: : It's only for noob.
  - :star::star:: It's easy, but not for noob.
  - :star::star::star:: Need to spend some time on this challenge.
  - :star::star::star::star:: It's definitely hard.
  - :star::star::star::star::star: : It's from hell.



- Challenge - Worth
  - :dollar: : I won't review this challenge.
  - :dollar::dollar: : If I'm not busy, I would review it.
  - :dollar::dollar::dollar: : I will definitely review it.
  - :dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar: : It'll be legacy of this year.
  - :dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar: : It's piece of art. 



If I think it's worth, I would leave detail writeup and impression, but if not, I would leave just solution codes or nothing.
