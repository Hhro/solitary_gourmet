# Solitary gourmet

It's my own CTF write up repository that includes some of my opinions. <u>Every assessments about CTFs and challenges are just my opinion</u>. You could think it's more difficult or more worthy than my assessment.

For now, every write-ups are written with Korean.

## Standards

Following these standards, I would evaluate several CTF challenges.

- Challenge - Difficulty
  - :star: : It's only for noob.
  - :star::star::​ It's easy, but not for noob.
  - :star::star::star:: Need to spend some time for this challenge.
  - :star::star::star::star:: It's definitely hard.
  - :star::star::star::star::star: : It's from hell.



- Challenge - Worth
  - :dollar: : I won't review this challenge.
  - :dollar::dollar: : If I'm not busy, I would review it.
  - :dollar::dollar::dollar: : I will definitely review it.
  - :dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar: : It'll be legacy of this year.
  - :dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar::dollar: : It's piece of art. 



If I think it's worth, I would leave detail writeup and impression, but if not, I would leave just solution codes or nothing.
